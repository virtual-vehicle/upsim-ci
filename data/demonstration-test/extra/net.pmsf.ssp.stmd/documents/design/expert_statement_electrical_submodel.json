    "content":"ASSUMPTIONS: The model will be used according to the investigation described in the Analysis Phase. CONSTRAINTS: The model shall be only used to investigate step responses with voltage steps of 40 to 50 Volts. JUSTIFICATIONS: The electrical submodel was taken from the Modelica Standard Library, as described in the Simulation Request. The heat transfer model was removed, as the component has already been used in a similar environment, therefore no further investigations with respect to heat realiability must be carried out. Copper losses, as required in model requirement ID 6 (see ./artifacts/requirements/model_06.json) are modelled with a resistance block. Magnetic losses are neglected in this submodel, as the losses are small compared to copper losses (smaller than 3%, according to datasheet \"./artifacts/documents/2-3-GP-DC-Motor-Datasheet.pdf\").",
