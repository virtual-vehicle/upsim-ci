# Test case

Justification of design specification with ID #spec_testcase:

As given in the requirements #req_test_01 and #req_test_02, a step response needs to be evaluated with a step from 0 to 48 V and a load of 1 Nm. 
Because evaluation is done after 1 second, it will be sufficient to run the simulation for not longer than 2 seconds.
