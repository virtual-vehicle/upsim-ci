- **General project information**
  - **Project name:** Mild Hybrid Variant AAA-55, 
  - **Project Number:** P987658, Subproject Modeling
  - **Version:** 2, 
  - **Project Leader:** J. Miller 
  
 (This is information is more a additional information, but only partly relevant for the modeling task)

- **Engineering task, development objectives and specifications of higher-level engineering process**
  - A variant of a mild hybrid drive based on the DDC platform is to be developed. 
  - This application is a low cost variant
- **Specific, detailed description of product, the requirements and environment (meant is the environment of the real product, e.g. for car -\> road, climate zone, user group, frequency of use, â€¦)**  
  - The subtask here is to make a pre-selection for a suitable DC electric motor in the early phase of the project. 
  - It is to be examined whether the DC motor with the type part number XY12346 is suitable in principle. 
  - Rationale: The DC motor type part number XY12345 is already used in automotive projects and meets the specific requirements for the application (temperature, vibration resistance, ...)
- **Analyzed simulation task and objectives**
  - Implementation and execution of a simulation based on a simple DC motor model. 
  - The effects which should be considered and neglected should be agreed with experts.
  - The simulation Task (sub Task) here is to make a pre-selection for a suitable DC electric motor in the early phase of the project. 
  - It is to be examined whether the DC motor with the type part number XY12346 is suitable in principle.
  - The DC motor must be able to accelerate from 0 to 1000 rad/s within 1 s at 48 V applied voltage and a load torque of 1 Nm.
  - parameter: New motor after 20 min running-in and 20 degrees Celsius

- **Modeling task and objectives**
  - Implementation of the mechanical part of a DC motor as simple simulation model. 
  - The effects which should be considered and neglected should be agreed with experts. 
  - Further input about requirements, design specification for the model is directly passed as input to the corresponding steps
- **Quality aspects according to the criticality of the decision of the simulation task**
  - Credibility Level 2
