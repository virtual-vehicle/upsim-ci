**Outputs:**
- **Revised specific, detailed description of product, requirements and environment (meant is the environment of the real product, e.g. for car -\> road, climate zone, user group, frequency of use, â€¦) which are relevant for modeling**
  - A variant of a mild hybrid drive based on the DDC platform is to be developed. 
  - This application is a low cost variant. 
  - In this simple example no further details or extension to inputs

- **Analyzed modeling task and objectives (including KPI and other criteria)**
  - The modeling Task (sub Task) here is to implement the mechanical part of a DC motor as simple simulation model. 
  - In this simple example no further details or extension to inputs.
